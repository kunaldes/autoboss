 * The Viewport class specifies a more advanced way than Visualization to
 * view the data in the cells. Should the user decide to use a Viewport other
 * than the default one automatically provided by the framework, they need to
 * specify how a given state should be drawn onto a Graphics object. This
 * class offers the most freedom of how a cellular automaton should be displayed
 * on screen, but most users should find the default sufficient for their needs
 * in 1 and 2 dimensions.
