/**
 * Defines a neighborhood around a given type of point, with a given radius.
 * This is used by the Rule objects to get all the neighbors around a given
 * cell, and eventually determine the new state of the center cell.
 * The neighborhood's origin - (0,0) in 2D - is the cell you are focusing
 * on, and all points around it are indexed with a relative point. For example,
 * if you have a Point2D neighborhood of radius 1, you can request values
 * between with x values between -1 and 1 inclusive, and y values between
 * -1 and 1 inclusive.
 * <br><br>
 * You can also iterate over all of the points in the neighborhood, <i>including</i>
 * the origin.
